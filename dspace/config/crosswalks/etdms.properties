# DSpace-to-ETDMS mapping
#
# <schema>.<element>.(<qualifier|*>) = <unqualified etdms element>
#
# You can map more then one metadata to the same etdms element, e.g.,
#
# dc.subject = subject
# dc.subject.lcsh = subject
#
# If a DSpace element must be mapped to multiple ETDMS elements, use a
# comma-delimited list, e.g.,
#
# dc.publisher = publisher, grantor
#
# The ETDMS schema requires some elements to be nested under <degree>.
# The following elements:
#
# name
# level
# discipline
# grantor
#
# ... will be created as children of the <degree> element.  No special notation
# is required in the mapping. E.g.,
#
# dc.publisher             = publisher, grantor
# dc.some.discipline.field = discipline
#
# will result in the the following:
#
# ...
# <publisher>[publisher name]</publisher>
# <degree>
#   <grantor>[publisher name]</grantor>
#   <discipline>[discipline]</discipline>
# </degree>
